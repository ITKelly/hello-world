I have an associate degree in Graphic and Web Design. I built a few websites from scratch while in school and didn't struggle too much. But classes focused on design, not developmnet, and that's where the jobs are. I wasn't too interested in being a graphic designer, I didn't feel I had the talent. But school sparked my interest in technology. I landed a job as a help desk tech II and a few more help desk positions after. Then decided I needed to get some certification so that I can stop it with the imposter syndrome. That hasn't gone away yet and I am pretty sure it won't for decades to come. I worked for 4 straight months to get certified in networks. That also sparked my interest. I cannot, however, seem to find a job that will let me use what I learned. My last temp position made me understand how much time I was wasting and how little merit I held. I quit. Now I am trying to figure out what to do next and today, found this awesome web development boot camp course on Udemy. 
So we shall see where this takes me.
